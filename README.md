# Applied Econometrics I
Welcome to **Applied Econometrics I**! As the title suggests, this is the first course
of a two-semester journey designed to teach you the theory and skills needed to conduct
robust empirical analysis in economics and related fields.

While this is an "applied" course, our first semester will mainly focus on the
**theoretical principles** of the models we will use next semester.

## Our guiding principle

> **In order to be a good applied scientist, you must understand the theory behind the
> tools you use.**
